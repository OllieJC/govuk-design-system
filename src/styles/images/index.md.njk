Avoid unnecessary decoration. Only use images if there’s a real user need.

## Aspect ratio

### Photography

The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "default", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}


### Illustrations or representative imagery

If your image represents something physical, such as a letter, document or credit card you should use the aspect ratio of that item.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "representative", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}


## Descriptive text

All images, except decorative images, must have descriptive text that:

- tells people what information the image provides
- describes the content and function of the image
- is specific, meaningful and concise

You should provide descriptions in the body text, as this makes the information available to all users.

If possible, describe the image’s content without referring to the image format. For example, write “Larry the cat, sitting on a meeting table, wearing a bowtie”, instead of “an image of Larry the cat”.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "alt-text", html: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}


### When to use alternative text

Users of assistive technology (for example, screen readers) use alt text as an alternative to images.

However, alt text is not accessible to all users. To make the description available to everyone, you should:

- use the body text to describe what's happening in the image
- leave the 'alt text field' empty

However, if it would not make sense to describe an image on the page, then add alt text. For example, when using an icon.

### How to use alternative text

Use normal punctuation, like commas and full stops, so the text is easy to read and understand.

Do not:

- include the name of the photographer or person who created the image
- start with ‘Image of’, ‘Graphic of’ or ‘Photo of’
- repeat information from the page
- include extra information not in the image

Some images do not need descriptions. This means you should also use `alt=""`  if the image is:

- decorative and does not include important content
- an icon that has a text label that the alt text would repeat
- used in a link and the image is not needed to understand the link

Use the [Web Accessibility initiative alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) to work out if an image needs alt text.

Avoid images that contain text, especially PNGs and JPGs because the text becomes unreadable when the user zooms in. If the image does contain text, use SVG because it remains readable when the user zooms in.
