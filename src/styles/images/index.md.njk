Avoid unnecessary decoration. Only use images if there’s a real user need.

## Aspect ratio

### Photography

The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "default", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}


### Illustrations or representative imagery

If your image represents something physical, such as a letter, document or credit card you should use the aspect ratio of that item.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "representative", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}


## Alternative text

Users of assistive technology (for example, screen readers) use alt text as an alternative to images.

However, alt text is not accessible to all users. To make the description available to everyone, you should:

- use the body text to describe what's happening in the image
- leave the 'Alt text field' empty

If possible, describe the image's content without referring to the format itself. For example, write "Larry the cat, sitting on a meeting table, wearing a bowtie", instead of "an image of Larry the cat".

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "alt-text", html: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}


Avoid images that contain text, especially PNGs and JPGs because the text becomes unreadable when the user zooms in. If the image does contain text, use SVG because it remains readable when the user zooms in.
